I'd just walked away from an extremely lucrative job while I was still
an undergrad student at [UTC](https://www.utc.edu/) because I wanted to
create my own business and focus on the same things I did for other
people, but with all the risk and reward.  During the summer of 2003,
I launched [Lakesite.Net](https://lakesite.net) as an extension of my
interests in programming services and hosting.

Previous to that, I built out two ISPs that also focused on providing
hosting services.  I had fun working with the [Internet Systems
Consortium](https://www.isc.org/) Berkeley Internet Name Domain
[Bind](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) DNS software, in addition
to a host of open source tools used for Internet and network
infrastructure (NTP, DHCP, DNS, etc).  I was fortunate enough to be
delegated authority over reverse DNS for my static IP and connection
with
[ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network), which allowed me to run DNS for a small ISP out of Hawaii that
hosted web sites and shell accounts.  

I also had my first commercial software development experience working
on quotation software for insurance agencies out of Hartford, CT where
I was introduced to some good and bad habits.  I thought I could do a
better job, and so I started my official entrepreneurial adventure
with a sole proprietorship.

Because I formed the equivalent of a digital agency
([di](http://www.duncaningram.com/)) with my [business partner Kim](http://kimberlydingram.com/) within a few years of collaborating
with her on various projects that complimented our
strengths/weaknesses, I left Lakesite.Net in the same original state
from 2003 until just recently.  This is partially because of
positioning, and because I want to do more programming services that
aren't so creative (and focus on open source business models), while
putting my creative efforts into di.  So now I need to actually
promote what Lakesite does in a completely separate way than what Kim
and I do through di.  I see this as a great opportunity to also try a
few things I wouldn't normally do, and bring those experiences back to
di.

I see my now LLC as an experiment in recalibrating my own professional
development and marketing efforts that I'll bring back to
the table in di during our own website update.  Thinking about
Lakesite's [client welcome packet](https://lakesite.net/welcome) which
needs so much work, will compliment the same updates we'll go through
on di, since we now use a few different tools and processes.  While
actual agile software development practices have become broadly
accepted, most small business customers want to manage their risk with
a set quote or package, which is separate from the kind of programming
services I'm more directly involved with.  

When we first started working together, I remember thinking that for
work we felt would take more than three months to finish, there's no
way we'd manage risk with any kind of rigidity.  For smaller projects,
clients want you to take the risk up front and quote them out a set of
features for a given price that meet a level of quality.  Many
agencies and software developers will cut corners because, they're
putting a bow on a package and letting it go, to become someone else's
problem later.  At di, we've been quick to differentiate between a
short term marketing effort and a long term investment in a project
that saves time and money.  This helps.

I see a need for a separate position and personality between two of my
companies.  For product development, marketing, front-end development,
digital strategy and design, and certain types of startup consulting I
want to bring clients into di.  For pure programming services and
consulting related to closer to engineering practices, Lakesite gives
me more flexibility to try things that might fail, and ultimately
bring that success to a larger team.
